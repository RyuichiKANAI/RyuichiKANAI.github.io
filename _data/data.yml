    info:
      - role: Visiting Researcher 
        time: 2019 - Present
        company: Alan Turing Institute, London, the U.K.
        details: |
          There is some previous research showing that anomalies occur in the atmosphere before earthquakes occur. 
          However, the analysis in those previous studies has not been verified as adequate. If earthquakes can 
          be predicted, it would be beneficial to many areas; however, if the research is inappropriate, 
          it can lead to the dissemination of misinformation. Therefore, we have obtained knowledge from Japanese 
          researchers who have knowledge of earthquakes and from Japanese and British researchers who can 
          analyze atmospheric data, and we are using statistics to conduct appropriate analysis. 
          As a person who can use both Japanese and English, I also work as a bridge to connect their knowledge.
      - role: Chief 
        time: 2018 - 2019
        company: NEC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan
        details: |
          As a member of a team, I analyzed data provided by clients. 
          For example, there was so much accumulated data that the client was not even able to identify 
          trends in the survey results. In this case, the customer did not have a specific issue, 
          so our team decided that it would be meaningful to indicate what geographic trends the questionnaire 
          could show. Hence, questionnaires were analyzed by natural language processing and then clustering 
          analysis was conducted to extract regional trends. The reason for this analysis is that our team expected 
          that the questionnaire results would differ from region to region and that the actions taken by each 
          branch would not be the same. 
          I summarized the results of the analyses by the younger colleagues into a document and made revisions 
          until I received an approval from my boss.
      - role: Deputiy Director
        time: 2017 - 2017
        company: Financial Services Agency, the Government of Japan
        details: |
          The most difficult part of the job was managing more than 10 subordinates, 
          as I was concurrently working in three different departments. Since it was impossible to meet 
          with all subordinates in person every day, I told all subordinates to always report any progress 
          or problems that arose in their work via e-mail. In ensuring that the team would perform properly, 
          I believed that it was of primary importance that the members of the team continue to work without 
          attrition and in good health. On the other hand, because the organization was extremely conservative, 
          I had seen many instances where such a structure was not realized, thus my team focused on this point. 
          In order for my subordinates to trust me, not only do I listen to whatever they tell me, but if there 
          is logical justification for their suggestions, I take the risk of communicating those suggestions to 
          those in higher positions and making them happen. This risk-taking has led to their trust in me, and 
          has helped me build a relationship with them, where they are willing to share information without 
          concealment.
